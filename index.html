                <p class="text-muted text-left">Monroe Township is a sprawling, suburban/semi-rural community in the southernmost part of Middlesex County, NJ. Its significant demographic characteristic is the presence of two large distinct populations: young families with pre-school and school age children, and older adults, most of whom live in the ten pre-retirement and retirement communities located in the Township. Approximately 15,000 of the Townshipâ€™s 39,132 residents live in these adult communities. A large majority of them are over 60 years of age and most moved to Monroe from the Greater Metropolitan New York Area following retirement.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">American football is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with possession of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it, while the defense, the team without possession of the ball, aims to stop the offense's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays; if they fail, they turn over the football to the defense, but if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive. Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins.</p>
